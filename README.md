Access at: http://localhost:5001

## Usage

Enter two locations (callsigns, grid squares, or coordinates) and the tool will:

1. Look up locations (from FCC database if callsign)
2. Calculate great circle distance and bearing
3. Compute link budget (path loss, fade margin)
4. Generate elevation profile with Fresnel zone analysis
5. Show if terrain is blocking your signal

### Example Inputs

- **Callsigns:** `AK6MJ` → `KM6LYW`
- **Addresses:** `Sacramento, CA` → `Mount Diablo, CA`
- **Cities/Landmarks:** `Berryessa Peak` → `Cool, CA`
- **Node Aliases:** `AK6MJ` → `KBERR` (Berryessa Peak digi)
- **Grid Squares:** `CM98jq` → `CM98kq`
- **Coordinates:** `38.6779,-121.1761` → `38.8894,-121.0156`

**Address Geocoding:** Powered by OpenStreetMap (Nominatim). Enter any address, city, or landmark!

## Repeater Coverage Lookup

The repeater coverage feature helps you discover which repeaters are reachable from your location using real terrain analysis:

### Setup

1. **Get a RepeaterBook API Key** (free for non-commercial use):
   - Visit https://www.repeaterbook.com/
   - Create a free account
   - Generate an API key

2. **Configure the API Key**:
   ```bash
   export REPEATERBOOK_API_KEY="your-api-key-here"
   ```

### Usage

1. Enter your location (callsign, address, grid square, or coordinates)
2. Select your state (2-letter code, e.g., CA, WA)
3. Set search radius (default: 80km / ~50 miles)
4. Configure your radio parameters:
   - TX power (watts)
   - Antenna height (meters)
   - Antenna type
5. Select bands to search (2m, 70cm, etc.)
6. Click "Find Repeaters"

### Results

The tool will:
- Query RepeaterBook for nearby repeaters in the selected bands
- Calculate distance to each repeater
- Perform terrain analysis for line-of-sight determination
- Calculate link budget including:
  - Path loss
  - Terrain obstruction loss
  - Received signal strength
  - Fade margin
- Classify each repeater as:
  - ✓ **Clear** - Direct line-of-sight path
  - ⚠ **Marginal** - Partial Fresnel zone obstruction
  - ⚠ **Obstructed** - Significant terrain obstruction
  - ✗ **Blocked** - No viable path

### CHIRP Export

Export reachable repeaters to a CHIRP-compatible CSV file for easy radio programming:

1. Complete a repeater search
2. Click "Download CHIRP File"
3. Open the CSV file in CHIRP
4. Upload to your radio

The exported file includes:
- Frequency
- Offset (+ or -)
- CTCSS tone
- Callsign and location
- Distance from your location

## Built-in Node Aliases

- `KBERR` - Berryessa Peak Digipeater (KE6YUV)
- `KJOHN` - Livermore Node (KF6ANX-4)
- `COOL` - Cool BBS Node (KM6LYW-4)
- `WAQTH` - WA QTH - Freeland (AK6MJ)
